A Simple Vue Calendar App
=========================

This is a simple calendar application written in Vue, using Vuex for state management.

To run it:
```
yarn
yarn serve
```

To run tests:
```
yarn test:unit
```

What's missing?
---------------

- Tests for `views/Event` and `components/Event/*`
- Tablet/Desktop layout
- It would be nice if events were saved in some more persistent place than localStorage
